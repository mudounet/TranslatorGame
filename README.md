# Translator Game

This little game is aimed at improving translation, by filling holes, until correct return is given.

## Installation

Currently, installation is not fully automatized. So, it is necessary to copy lessons.xml (copy is present into directory `translatorGame\src\main\assets`) into your Android device, in directory created by the game, in my case `TranslatorGame`, at the root of either internal or external storage.

Of course, it doesn't work unless `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is given.
